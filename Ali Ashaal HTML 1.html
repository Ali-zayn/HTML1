          <h2>Who Was Isaac Newton?</h2>
          <p>Isaac Newton was a physicist and mathematician who developed the principles of modern physics.
            <br>Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England.
            <br>In 1687, he published his most acclaimed work, 
            <br><i>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy)</i>,
            <br>which has been called the single most influential book on physics. 
            <br>In 1705, he was knighted by Queen Anne of England, making him Sir Isaac Newton.

            <h3>Isaac Newton's Education:</h3>
            <p>Newton was enrolled at the King's School in Grantham, a town in Lincolnshire,
             <br> where he lodged with a local apothecary and was introduced to the fascinating world of chemistry.
             <br>His mother pulled him out of school at age 12. Her plan was to make him a farmer and have him tend the farm.
             <br> Newton failed miserably, as he found farming monotonous.
             <br> Newton was soon sent back to King's School to finish his basic education.
             <br>Perhaps sensing the young man's innate intellectual abilities,
             <br>his uncle, a graduate of the <u>University of Cambridge's Trinity College</u>u,
             <br>persuaded Newton's mother to have him enter the university.
             <br>Newton enrolled in a program similar to a work-study in 1661, 
             <br>and subsequently waited on tables and took care of wealthier students' rooms.

            <h3>Legacy:</h3>
            <p>Newton's fame grew even more after his death,
             <br>as many of his contemporaries proclaimed him the greatest genius who ever lived.
             <br>Maybe a slight exaggeration, but his discoveries had a large impact on Western thought,
             <br>leading to comparisons to the likes of <u>Plato</u>, Aristotle and Galileo.
             <br>Of course, Newton was proven wrong on some of his key assumptions.
             <br>In the 20th century, <u>Albert Einstein</u> would overturn Newton's concept of the universe,
             <br>stating that space, distance and motion were not absolute but relative
             <br>and that the universe was more fantastic than Newton had ever conceived.
